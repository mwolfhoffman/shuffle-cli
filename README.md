# Python Shuffle CLI

Shuffle allows users to create teams/groups and then shuffle their members randomly. This can be used in schools and other settings for creating random teams for group work. 

I orignally built this as a vue.js, node.js, mongoDB app in 2016 for a code school in Boise, Idaho to use. 

This project is a very basic CLI to practice some of the Python commands I will need in my re-write for Shuffle. I am planning to write a new serverless version of that app using AWS Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, EC2, and other features to learn more about cloud architecture and AWS offerings.

This is a very basic CLI so not all CRUD operations that exist in the full Shuffle app will appear here. 

## Features

1. Create and Read Teams.
2. Add members to a team.
3. Shuffle teams and split them into groups of differeing sizes.

## Technology Used:

1. Python 3.x is required
